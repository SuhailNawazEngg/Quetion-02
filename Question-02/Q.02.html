<h2>write the difference between var let and const with code example??</h2>

<p>

    var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope.

  Example Var:var greeter = "hey hi";
  var times = 4;

  if (times > 3) {
      var greeter = "say Hello instead"; 
  }
  
  console.log(greeter) // "say Hello instead"

             <br>

  Example Let:let greeting = "say Hi";
  let times = 4;

  if (times > 3) {
       let hello = "say Hello instead";
       console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
   }
  console.log(hello) // hello is not defined

                <br>

  Example Const:const greeting = "say Hi";
  greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable.
